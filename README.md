# Job-Portal
Created a job posting hub that catalogues all job listings at one place with admin authentication. 
It uses EJS templating that creates new openings on the fly without hardcoding the new page. 
It utilizes Node.js as back-end, MVC as framework and MongoDB as database for creating the web application.
